# Password Generator

## Overview

This Python program generates strong and secure passwords based on user input. The user can customize the number of letters, numbers, and symbols to include in their password. The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from predefined lists and then shuffling them to enhance security.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Length**: Allows users to specify how many letters, numbers, and symbols to include in the password.
- **Random Selection**: The program selects random characters from a pool of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Shuffling**: After generating the initial password components, the password is shuffled to ensure randomness.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
